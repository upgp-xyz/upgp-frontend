🧭 The Philosophy Behind upgp.xyz
"Trust shouldn’t stop at the transport layer."

While HTTPS ensures a secure tunnel, it doesn’t protect the integrity or authenticity of the content itself. upgp.xyz goes a step further:

Every payload is signed — not just sent.

Every upload is encrypted — not just transmitted.

Every trust decision is client-verifiable — no silent assumptions.

This creates a portable trust model:

It works even behind CDNs, proxies, or caches.

It proves that the content is authentic, not just the channel.

It empowers the user — not just the infrastructure — to decide what's trustworthy.

🔐 Why PGP?
PGP gives users something HTTPS cannot:
End-to-end, content-level cryptographic assurance — without needing to trust the server blindly.

🌐 The Vision
A safer web where encryption and verification are embedded in the data — not just in the connection.

This isn't just about securing files. It's about shifting trust from infrastructure to intent — from systems to signatures.
